==============

A suicide kings/DKP system for WoW

This will include a few UI additions as well, listed in a seperate list below

This loot distribution system is different than any other, as it combines the positive elements of both the DKP and 
Suicide Kings systems.

It will allow for quick addition of any players (including cross realm) to the master list, as well as full guild and
group imports to the master list. 

Multiple lists for loot distribution will be creatable by the user, and allow a choice of which to use
for every auction.

A function to quickly decrement/increment the current in group players will be present

A function that automatically assigns "DKP" when a raid boss is killed we be present

A function to start, end, cancel, accept, and deny auctions/bids
  -This will include an officer override button, that allows an auction to be fully canceled

A function that allows the user to set the amount of "DKP" given for boss kills
    --future implementation of setting events, and DKP per event ie, completing a dungeon that yields guild rewards

A function to automatically give loot to the winning bidder and auto decrement ALL "DKP" except 1

A function to decrement an individual at will by the leader
  -limitation placed on "Raid Leader" and "Master Looter"
